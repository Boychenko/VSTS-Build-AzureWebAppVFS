# Azure WebApp Virtual File System Tasks

A custom task for deleting files and/or folders as part of an Azure DevOps app service deployment, with deployment slot support & fixes for issues found in upstream.

If you want to deploy this extension and use it as a part of your build, please consult Microsoft's documentation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/extend/publish/overview?view=azure-devops

In the future I may publish this publically, but for now you must do it yourself. Pull requests are more than welcome.
